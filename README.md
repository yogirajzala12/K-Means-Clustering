# K-Means-Clustering
K-means clustering is popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.Typically, unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

the objective of K-means is simple: group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns. To achieve this objective, K-means looks for a fixed number (k) of clusters in a dataset.
